# BachelorThesis
This repository is about the my Bachelor's thesis at Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in SNU, Seoul, Korea. It was done as a graduation project in  a course, "Integrated Design of Aerospace System".

The advisor was Prof. Changdon, Kee.

To put it personally, I learned a lot of things which help me deeply think about the way to make a research, form my own idea, live as an individual with the solid and sound values, from my honorable professor.

It deals with a celestial navigation system in the outer space, especially on the lunar exporation orbit.

I mainly followed the Mortari, D's work[3][6]. The main algorithms are 'Least Squares' and 'Weighted Least Squares'.

The details will be done in a form of a paper.
