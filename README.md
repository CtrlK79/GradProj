# Intro
This repository is about the my Bachelor's thesis at [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in SNU, Seoul, Korea](https://aerospace.snu.ac.kr/). It was done as a graduation project in the course named "Integrated Design of Aerospace System".

My honorable advisor was [Prof. Changdon, Kee](http://gnss.snu.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub1_1).

Although my work was just a simple project with undergraduate-level, I learned a lot about the process of research, thanks to my honorable professor.

This work deals with CNS(Celestial Navigation System) using star tracker and planets ephemeris.

The main algorithm is based on LS(Least Squares) and WLS(Weighted Least Squares) optimization, which was already investigated before[4][5].

Even though this work consists of rudimentary ideas and results from the works already done, It has a meaning in that It reveals the exact factors which affect the performance of the navigation algorithm.
